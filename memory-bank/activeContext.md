# Active Context: DitherMan

## Current Work Focus

- Initial setup of the Memory Bank for the DitherMan project.
- Documenting project brief, product context, technical context, system patterns, and current progress.

## Recent Changes

- Created and populated all core Memory Bank files with up-to-date information from the codebase and documentation.

## Next Steps

- Keep Memory Bank updated as new features are added or changes are made.
- Use this documentation as the single source of truth for project context and decision-making.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- All image processing and dithering logic is modular and offloaded to a Web Worker for performance.
- The UI is designed for real-time feedback and ease of use.
- The Memory Bank will be updated after any significant project changes.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Modular code structure for maintainability.
- Use of TypeScript and ESLint for code quality.
- Real-time, non-blocking UI updates.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The current architecture supports extensibility for new dithering algorithms and adjustments.
- The Memory Bank is essential for onboarding and maintaining project continuity.
