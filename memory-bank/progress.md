# Progress: DitherMan

## What Works

- Users can upload images and see a real-time preview of dithering results.
- Multiple dithering algorithms are available: Floyd-Steinberg, Bayer, Atkinson, Sierra.
- Image adjustments (contrast, highlights, midtones, blur, luminance, invert) are functional.
- Palette selection (Black & White, Grayscale) works as intended.
- Downloading processed images as PNG or JPG is supported.
- All processing is performed client-side using a Web Worker for performance.
- Codebase has been refactored for maintainability, modularity, and performance as planned.

## What's Left to Build

- No major features or refactorings are currently in progress.
- Future improvements may include additional dithering algorithms, more adjustment options, or UI enhancements as needed.

## Current Status

- The application is fully functional and meets the initial project goals.
- All planned code optimizations and refactoring have been completed.
- The Memory Bank is up to date with the current state of the project.

## Known Issues

- No critical functional issues documented.
- Further improvements will be tracked as new tasks arise.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Chose React + TypeScript + Vite for modern, maintainable development.
- Adopted a modular architecture for extensibility.
- Prioritized performance and user experience by offloading processing to a Web Worker.
- Established the Memory Bank as the central documentation and context resource.
