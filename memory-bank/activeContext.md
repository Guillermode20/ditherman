# Active Context: DitherMan

## Current Work Focus

- The codebase review and planned optimizations/refactorings are complete.
- The project is now in a maintenance and improvement phase, ready for new features or enhancements as needed.

## Recent Changes

- Completed a comprehensive review and refactoring of `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `src/App.tsx`, and `src/imageWorker.ts`.
- Consolidated state management in `App.tsx` using a fully typed `useReducer`.
- All state-changing handlers and reset logic use `keyof State` for type safety.
- The invert button uses a dedicated toggle handler.
- React-idiomatic DOM interaction is in place (controlled components, `useRef` for canvases).
- `App.tsx` has been broken down into `Sidebar` and `CanvasDisplay` components, improving modularity and maintainability.
- All state and handlers are passed as props to these components.
- Worker instantiation in `App.tsx` has been simplified (directly created in useEffect).
- Debug `console.log` removed from `src/imageWorker.ts`.
- useCallback usage reviewed and unnecessary wrappers removed from handlers that only call dispatch or use stable refs.
- Error handling implemented in the worker (`src/imageWorker.ts` now posts error messages to the main thread).
- Memory Bank updated after each major change.

## Next Steps

- Awaiting new feature requests, further improvements, or additional code review as needed.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The recent optimizations have improved code structure, readability, maintainability, and adherence to React best practices.
- All image processing and dithering logic remains modular and offloaded to a Web Worker.
- The Memory Bank will continue to be updated after any significant project changes.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Modular code structure for maintainability.
- Use of TypeScript and ESLint for code quality.
- Real-time, non-blocking UI updates.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The current architecture supports extensibility for new dithering algorithms and adjustments.
- The Memory Bank is essential for onboarding and maintaining project continuity.
