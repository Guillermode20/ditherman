# Progress: DitherMan

## What Works

- Users can upload images and see a real-time preview of dithering results.
- Multiple dithering algorithms are available: Floyd-Steinberg, Bayer, Atkinson, Sierra.
- Image adjustments (contrast, highlights, midtones, blur, luminance, invert) are functional.
- Palette selection (Black & White, Grayscale) works as intended.
- Downloading processed images as PNG or JPG is supported.
- All processing is performed client-side using a Web Worker for performance.

## What's Left to Build

- No major missing features identified at this stage.
- Future improvements may include additional dithering algorithms, more adjustment options, or UI enhancements.

## Current Status

- The application is fully functional and meets the initial project goals.
- The Memory Bank has been set up and populated with current project context.

## Known Issues

- No critical issues documented at this time.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Chose React + TypeScript + Vite for modern, maintainable development.
- Adopted a modular architecture for extensibility.
- Prioritized performance and user experience by offloading processing to a Web Worker.
- Established the Memory Bank as the central documentation and context resource.
